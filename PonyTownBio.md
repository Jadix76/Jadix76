<p> Hello! I'm Jadix! I literally just made this account for Pony town lol.
<p> I probably won't interact much, and will most likely not see messages unless you whisper to me as i'm usually off tab
<p> Please don't completely copy my characters!
<p> I use dreamy/magical/mystical (<- categories, not specific neos) neopronouns and she/her (neos preferred however). NO THEY/THEM OR HE/HIM!
<p> I am bigender, my two genders are girl and kitsunegender!
<p> I AM A MINOR! I did play on the 18+ server for a bit, but I currently chill on the PG server bc, y'know, not an adult, lol
<p> I do have touch discomfort however i do not experience phantom touch! I would still prefer not to be touched or covered however
<p> I am a cosplayer, i chill in the MCYT area, all of my characters are MCYT! Most are specifically from OriginsMCRP, only one is not (Showtime Steve)
